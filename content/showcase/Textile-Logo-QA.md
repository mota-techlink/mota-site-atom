### The Challenge: Ensuring Brand Consistency on Textiles

In the fast-paced apparel industry, maintaining brand consistency is paramount. However, quality control for logos and prints on textiles is a notoriously difficult task. Fabric is not a rigid material; its inherent properties introduce a host of problems for traditional automated inspection systems.

Key challenges include:

*   **Deformation and Displacement:** Textiles can stretch, shrink, and warp during manufacturing, causing the logo to appear distorted or shifted compared to the original design.
*   **Inconsistent Lighting:** The perceived color and brightness of a logo can change dramatically due to shifting ambient light in a workshop, such as from personnel movement or time of day.
*   **Texture Interference:** The weave and texture of the fabric itself can create visual noise, confusing algorithms and making it difficult to isolate the logo for accurate comparison.

### The Solution: A Multi-Stage Machine Vision Pipeline

The DiffScanner project tackles these industry-specific challenges head-on with a sophisticated pipeline that leverages both classic machine vision and modern machine learning techniques. It intelligently preprocesses and aligns images before comparison, ensuring that only meaningful differences are flagged.

Our approach consists of several key stages:

1.  **Robust Image Alignment:** To counter stretching and displacement, we employ a two-step alignment process.
    *   **Global Alignment:** Using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm, the system identifies unique feature points in both the template and the inspection image. It then computes a homography matrix to correct for large-scale rotation, scaling, and perspective distortion.
    *   **Fine-Grained Correction:** To handle subtle, non-rigid warping characteristic of fabric, we then apply a Dense Optical Flow algorithm. This technique calculates the precise displacement of each pixel, effectively "stretching" the inspection image to perfectly match the template on a local level.

2.  **Adaptive Brightness & Color Correction:** To solve the problem of variable lighting, the system normalizes the images before comparison. By converting images to the L*a*b* color space, we can isolate the Lightness (L*) channel and mathematically adjust it to match the template's brightness, ensuring that color comparisons are accurate regardless of shop floor lighting conditions.

3.  **Texture Suppression:** We use a series of morphological filters and adaptive thresholding techniques to separate the logo from the underlying fabric texture. By enhancing the logo's features while minimizing the high-frequency noise of the weave, we provide a clean, clear image for the final difference analysis.

By addressing the unique properties of textiles, this solution provides a reliable and automated way to solve a persistent quality control headache in the garment industry, demonstrating the power of applied machine vision.
